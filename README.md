# YoutubeGet1080p
Downloader for 1080p youtubevideo with audio


A simple python file for downloading a youtube video in 1080p and with audio. There are websites online that can do that for you. But they are doubious in nature and often do not have the option to download in full 1080p and/or do not have the audio present.

I combined the libraries pytube, ffmpy and os to pull of the URL and combine video and audio to the inputted filename.

You have to pip install all mentioned libs.

Output files are created in the folder op the python script.
